# Codex Deck

Generate a production-ready, 11-slide HTML presentation on Codex's five core primitives — targeted at product managers and non-technical audiences.

## What This Skill Produces

A single `presentation.html` file featuring:
- **11 slides** covering Codex, Skills, Sub Agents, Hooks, Multi-Agent Systems, architecture, PM use cases, and next steps
- **Bold Signal style**: dark background (#080810), orange accents (#f5a623), geometric diagonal shapes, clean Helvetica typography
- **Zero dependencies**: fully self-contained, works offline
- **Navigation**: arrow keys, spacebar, click, swipe — progress bar, slide counter
- **Speaker notes**: press `N` to toggle per-slide notes

## Slide Outline

| # | Title | Core Insight |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Title | Ship with Codex |
| 2 | What is Codex? | AI pair programmer in your terminal — reads, edits, runs, ships |
| 3 | The PM Superpower | Hours vs. engineering weeks |
| 4 | Concept 01 — Skills | Reusable workflows triggered by a slash command |
| 5 | Skills in Action | 6 real examples from the course |
| 6 | Concept 02 — Sub Agents | Delegate to specialist AI workers with isolated context |
| 7 | Concept 03 — Hooks | PreToolUse / PostToolUse / Stop / Notification |
| 8 | Concept 04 — Multi-Agent | Parallel fleets, scale beyond a single context window |
| 9 | How It All Fits | Layered architecture: Multi-Agent → Sub Agents → Skills → Hooks |
| 10 | What PMs Are Building | 4 real course builds with time-to-ship |
| 11 | Your Next 3 Steps | Install → run a skill → build a multi-agent workflow |

## Instructions

1. Copy the full HTML from `presentation.html` in the repo root (or regenerate it using the template below).
2. Save as `presentation.html` in the working directory.
3. Open with `open presentation.html` or deploy to Vercel:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /tmp/Codex-deck
   cp presentation.html /tmp/Codex-deck/index.html
   cd /tmp/Codex-deck && vercel deploy --yes
   ```
4. Share the Vercel URL. The deck is live in under 60 seconds.

## Regeneration Template

If the user wants to rebuild or customise the deck, use `frontend-slides` skill with these parameters:

- **Topic**: Codex — Skills, Sub Agents, Hooks, Multi-Agent Systems
- **Audience**: Product managers and non-engineers
- **Slides**: 11
- **Style**: Bold Signal (dark bg #080810, orange accent #f5a623, diagonal geometric shapes, Helvetica)
- **Vibe**: Impressed / Confident

Follow the slide outline above as the content structure. Every slide must:
- Have a **one-insight headline** (not a topic label)
- Fit entirely within `100vh` — no scrolling
- Use `clamp()` for all font sizes
- Include speaker notes in `data-notes` attribute
